node31-033.9896can't open /dev/ipath, network down (err=26)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
PSM was unable to open an endpoint. Please make sure that the network link is
active on the node and the hardware is functioning. 

  Error: Could not detect network connectivity

It looks like MPI_INIT failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during MPI_INIT; some of which are due to configuration or environment
problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure; here's some
additional information (which may only be relevant to an Open MPI
developer):

  PML add procs failed
  --> Returned "Error" (-1) instead of "Success" (0)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
[node31-033:9893] *** An error occurred in MPI_Init
[node31-033:9893] *** on a NULL communicator
[node31-033:9893] *** Unknown error
[node31-033:9893] *** MPI_ERRORS_ARE_FATAL: your MPI job will now abort
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
An MPI process is aborting at a time when it cannot guarantee that all
of its peer processes in the job will be killed properly.  You should
double check that everything has shut down cleanly.

  Reason:     Before MPI_INIT completed
  Local host: node31-033
  PID:        9893
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
mpirun has exited due to process rank 3 with PID 9896 on
node node31-033 exiting improperly. There are two reasons this could occur:

1. this process did not call "init" before exiting, but others in
the job did. This can cause a job to hang indefinitely while it waits
for all processes to call "init". By rule, if one process calls "init",
then ALL processes must call "init" prior to termination.

2. this process called "init", but exited without calling "finalize".
By rule, all processes that call "init" MUST call "finalize" prior to
exiting or it will be considered an "abnormal termination"

This may have caused other processes in the application to be
terminated by signals sent by mpirun (as reported here).
